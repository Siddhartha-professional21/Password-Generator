# Password-Generator

🔐 Password Generator (Vite + React + Tailwind CSS)
A responsive password generator web app built with Vite, React, and Tailwind CSS. This project helped me gain hands-on experience with React hooks like useState, useEffect, useCallback, and useRef. I also learned how to deploy a Vite-based React app using GitHub Pages. The app allows users to generate strong, customizable passwords with options for length, numbers, and special characters.
